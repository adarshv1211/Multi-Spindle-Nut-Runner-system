# Multi-Spindle-Nut-Runner-system
The Nut Runner &amp; Nut Drivers are tools used for tightening nuts. By definition, nut drivers are purely mechanical hand tools, while nut runners can be Pneumatic, Electrical or Hydraulic power tools. Now-a-days, multi spindle systems are used in vehicle assembly line, where all nuts of the wheels are tightened simultaneously. According to the quantity of nuts of wheel to be tightened simultaneously, the nut runner system is chosen. The project is based on development of existing system, which is used in vehicle assembly line for tightening of 4nos. of nuts of the vehicle wheels simultaneously, where nuts are tightened with desired torque. For 4-nut wheel vehicles, 4- nut runner multi spindle drive system is required, similarly for 5-nut wheel vehicles, 5-nut runner multi spindle drive system will be required. So, we can say that for different number of nuts of wheels of vehicle required different type of nut runner spindle drive system. Aim of the project is to make combination of 4-nut runner system and 5-nut runner system and build a single drive system which can be used for 4-nut wheel tightening as well as for 5-nut wheel tightening.
