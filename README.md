# Multi-Spindle-Nut-Runner-system
The Nut Runner &amp; Nut Drivers are tools used for tightening nuts. By definition, nut drivers are purely mechanical hand tools, while nut runners can be Pneumatic, Electrical or Hydraulic power tools. Now-a-days, multi spindle systems are used in vehicle assembly line, where all nuts of the wheels are tightened simultaneously. According to the quantity of nuts of wheel to be tightened simultaneously, the nut runner system is chosen. The project is based on development of existing system, which is used in vehicle assembly line for tightening of 4nos. of nuts of the vehicle wheels simultaneously, where nuts are tightened with desired torque. For 4-nut wheel vehicles, 4- nut runner multi spindle drive system is required, similarly for 5-nut wheel vehicles, 5-nut runner multi spindle drive system will be required. So, we can say that for different number of nuts of wheels of vehicle required different type of nut runner spindle drive system. Aim of the project is to make combination of 4-nut runner system and 5-nut runner system and build a single drive system which can be used for 4-nut wheel tightening as well as for 5-nut wheel tightening.
The demand for adjustable multi nut tighter and remover in large quantities is on the increase due to its ability to remove or tighten four-wheel nuts from a car tire at a time with less application of force. Cars are provided with tires for moving from one point to another by changing and maintaining direction of travel, absorbing road shocks, supporting vehicle weight and transferring traction and braking forces to the road surface. Sometimes the vehicle tires develop some problems and there is the need for the driver to remove the tires and fixes the problem. The problem to tighten the nuts does occur most times even if the nuts are successfully removed. And the driver’s safety is also at risk if the required torque is not applied in tightening the nuts.

To overcome the waste of time and high force needed, a tool has been designed to remove four nuts of a tire in single time with decremented applied force. CAR is not a symbol of luxury anymore. It is a need for every family. People need car due to several reasons. Some of them are, to go to a destination, to travel conveniently, to do daily job and to move things to a greater distance. The problem occurs the most during car operation is the problem with tire puncture. The punctured tire needed to be replaced with spare tire. Therefore, drivers need to know basic knowledge of tire replacement procedure if such problem occurs. In order to change the tire, one requires minimal skills. 
Virtually every car has a tire replacement tools such as the L-shaped nut remover and jack supplied by the manufacturer accurate tensioning of a screw is necessary. It has moreover been found that, at the high speeds used, ratchet couplings also apply a powerful shock action and are therefore likewise unsuitable for tightening expansion screws. 
Engineering in general, and Mechanical engineering in particular, deals with a wide spectrum of products, ranging from large and complex systems comprising of numerous elements down to a single component. The service offered by an automobile maintenance and repair. 
Garage would be a typical example from mechanical Engineering. Even computer software could be treated as an engineering product. 
It is also created using engineering knowledge and skills. In the following, the term product when used alone denotes the object to be designed and made with the help of engineering knowledge and skills, irrespective of whether it is a large system, a simple machine, a component or a service. A complex product can be sub divided into sub-assemblies or sub system, component etc. Frequently the planning, layout and design of a complex multi element product is an interdisciplinary effort, requiring the expertise and skills not only of several engineering specialization but even non engineering ones. It is always preferable that our work should be easy and fast. But easy and fast working requires some technical skills to work efficiency and properly.
 In a day-to-day life there are many problems where there is a need of lot of effort and time to do that specific work. A little but important work that all people would do often is opening a wheel of a vehicle. It is a fact that a huge effort is required to open a single nut of a car wheel and it will become a tedious task to open the wheel in extreme atmospheric conditions to the problem mentioned above by Adjustable Unified Wheel Opener, it is a special tool designed for opening a wheel with ease. 
It is so designed that it can open all the four nuts of a car wheel in one time. And the most desired achievement is that, the total effort and time needed in the process is very less. It can open and also refit the wheel with the same tool.

Mohd Azman. Abdullah, M.A.Sulaiman:  As the standard of living in Malaysia has increased, most of the families have at least one vehicle, typically, car, to move easily and quickly. With the increment of the number of cars in the road, the number of cars’ problem due to tyre failure has increased. Often, the car is provided with tire wheel nuts remover and jack for instance spare tyre replacement. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty in applying the required torque to remove the nuts, most of the time, driver rely on the tow truck and available nearest mechanic to solve the problem. This always happen to the elderly or female drivers. Based on the capability of torque application by these drivers, a vehicle all-wheel-nuts remover is designed. The remover is designed to be ergonomic to be used, easy maintenance, easy storage, easy to handle and able to remove all nuts at once. The design of the remover is based on standard pitch circle diameter (PCD) of 100 mm and 4 numbers of nuts for most of the cars available.

Chad E. Gooyers, Joan M. Stevenson:  Global competition in the manufacturing sector has created an environment for continuous improvement resulting in methods to increase capacity while lowering cost. Speed Fastening (SF) is one manufacturing assembly method currently being modified to improve its production capacity. This semi-automated riveting process is limited by a lack of continuous feed of fasteners supplied to the tool. One path to productivity improvement that has been identified for improving productivity in SF is the development of a continuous feed tool, which would eliminate non-value-added time currently scheduled for reloading. In preparation for the design of a new tool, a proactive investigation was conducted to characterize the influence of work rate (i.e. frequency of fastener insertion) on task demands (e.g. muscular effort, posture, etc.) for manual SF work.
X. S. Xu., T. W. McDowell:  To help assess the risk of the vibration exposure during impact wrench operation and to develop a convenient and effective method to monitor and control the exposure, this study aims to investigate the characteristics of the vibrations transmitted to the wrist and elbow in the operation and to evaluate the on-the-wrist and on-the-elbow vibration measurement methods.  This study also found that the accelerations measured at the wrist and elbow are correlated with the ISO frequency-weighted tool acceleration.  The results of this study also suggest that the on-the-wrist method can also be used at workplaces to perform screening tests of the tools with dominant vibration frequencies similar to those of the impact wrenches and to evaluate the effectiveness of the anti-vibration devices used with such tools.




METHODOLOGY

The design of the vehicle all-wheel-nuts remover (VAWNR) tool is performed by commercial computer aided design (CAD) software as shown by Figure 1.
Several static load analyses are also performed in order to find the safety factor of the design. Theoretical calculation analysis is carried out with the purpose of validation. The force required for removing four numbers of nuts is,                                                                      F = 4τ / (lRG)
 Where, F is the applied force, τ is the torque required to remove one nut, l is the length of level and RG is the gear ratio of central gear and driven gears of the tool. In the fabrication of VAWNR tool, two processes are performed; milling and fitting. Since the gears are not available in the market, custom designed gears need precision milling and fitting processes. Once the tool is ready, an experiment is performed with the intention to find the time required to remove the nuts. This result is then compared with the time required using ordinary L-shaped wrench. Experiment using impact wrench is also performed.



CONSTRUCTION

Five spur gears are arranged in such a way that, by applying some force with both the hands on the handle (which any normal person can do), gears will be rotated and finally required torque will be applied on the spanners to open the four-wheel nuts at a time. In this work, we concentrated on the application domain i.e., most of the passenger four wheelers. 
The main objective of this work is to develop a complete mechanism in one assembly, which can be used in automobiles. This machine is operated by an operator by applying force by using both the hands, due to which the central gear rotates in the same direction as the handle and by this motion the four output gears which are in mesh with the main gear rotates in opposite direction to the first. Five bearings are attached at the centers of five gears to transmit free rotational motion and to give the exact position to the gears.
 By this finally the force is transmitted to the sockets at the end of the connected rods, and thus the four nuts can be opened at once. Generally, spur gears are used for transmitting power between non parallel intersecting shafts. So, spur gear arrangement is used for actuating the four socket spanners at a time. Twelve driven gears and one pinion gear are used. The cam and follower mechanism are used for making the project adjustable. For this purpose, radial cam is used because the follower moves in the direction perpendicular to the cam axis. And spherical face follower is used because the side thrust and wear is considerably low.
 The pinion gear is meshing with four auxiliary gears which are in turning connected to a gear whose axle containing the socket spanners at its end. The auxiliary gear connected to a hollow shaft (main shaft) which is acting as a guide for follower. The other end of the follower is connected to a bevel gear. A lock nut arrangement is provided for connecting the main shaft to follower at any desired position.
 


DIMENSIONAL DRAWING


 COMPONENT DETAILS
•	BOX SPANNER SOCKET
    The second type socket wrench is a box design is very similar. The head of the socket wrench that is completely the same as the nut / bolt head cover and the sense of the handle not fixed. The socket is a hexagonal shape or size estimate which itself is either a square.


•	SHAFT
      Shaft is a rotating machine element, usually circular in cross section, which is used to transmit power from one part to another, or from a machine which produces power to a machine which absorbs power.


•	BASE PLATE
 In order to keep the forces and means of the gear base plate is used to withstand the gears and the shaft extension. To remove the weight and increases the stability of the device. This is a plate made of cast iron. Mild steel is selected for plate.

•	BEARINGS
A ball bearing is a type of rolling-element bearing that uses balls to maintain the separation between the bearing races. The purpose of a ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. It achieves this by using at least three races to contain the balls and transmit the loads through the balls. As one of the bearing races rotates it causes the balls to rotate as well. Because the balls are rolling, they have a much lower coefficient of friction than if two flat surfaces were sliding against each other. Ball bearings tend to have lower load capacity for their size than other kinds of rolling-element bearings due to the smaller contact area between the balls and races.

•	LEVER  
   A handle is a part of, or attachment to, an object that can be moved or used by hand. The design of each type of handle involves substantial ergonomic issues, even where these are dealt with intuitively or by following tradition. Handles for tools are an important part of their function, enabling the user to exploit the tools to maximum effect. Package handles allow for convenient carrying of packages.

•	FUTURE SCOP
   It acts as a convenient and simple method for tyre replacement process thus It is more suitable in using this setup for tyre removal in every vehicle for reducing the time consumed and for reducing the man power wasted for the tyre replacement and to overcome the emergency situations. Thus, the vehicle multi wheel nuts remover and tightener can be used in all automobile shops and can be carried in each vehicle for instant tyre replacement which saves lot of time and energy for every person.
